# Front-End Web Style Guide at Rolling Glory

This site is a component library that will be modified according to element collages from designers. Serves as a boilerplate for future projects. Components currently include:
- Colors
- Typography
- Form elements
- Buttons
- Navigation elements

## File Structure
We use [LESS](lesscss.org) for styling. This boilerplate consists of four .less files:
- `references.less` declares classes that used as reference in every less file whenever needed. Note : This references must be clean and should not be compiled and added to CSS.
- `variables.less` declares static variables that are used throughout the site. Examples include colors, font families, and gap size.
- `utilities.less` declares classes that are commonly needed, such as unstyled list and clearfix.
- `components.less` is the core of this boilerplate. It declares classes for components such as forms, buttons, and tabs.
- `style.less` compiles all of the previously mentioned files, as well as declares stylings specific to this RGBase web page.


## Usage
Clone the repository and edit the component library for each project according to the element collage from your designer. This website is under construction. Once all features are available, you should be able to see the markups for each component on the site as well.
